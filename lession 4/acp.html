        <h3>type of person i am</h3>
        <p>
            my personality is full of choes and soft girl aesthetics. I like living in my own world i’m the kind of girl
            who falls in love with moments — golden hour light, soft music in the background, the way someone says your
            name like it matters.
            i romanticize everything — the way i make my pasta, the drama in a love story, the silence after a good cry.
            i’m emotional (yes), dramatic (of course), and soft with a little spice and i spill tea like it’s self-care.
            i live in between love letters and playlist lyrics, always searching for something beautiful — or chaotic —
            to feel.
            main character energy? absolutely.
            but make it pink, personal, and a little bit unhinged.

        <h3>how my playlist look like </h3>
        <p>Taylor Swift's "Love Story" is a modern fairytale woven with timeless emotions. Inspired by the classic tale
            of Romeo and Juliet, the song flips the tragic ending into a hopeful, romantic escape. It tells the story of
            two young lovers kept apart by disapproving families, only to reunite through faith in their love. With
            poetic lyrics, sweeping violins, and Swift’s signature storytelling, “Love Story” captures the intensity of
            secret glances, whispered promises, and dreams of forever. It’s not just a song — it’s a feeling. A daydream
            where love wins, hearts race, and happily-ever-after still exist</p>

        <h3>my favriout influncer </h3>
        <p>Apoorva, aka Rebel Kid, is the kind of girl who walks into a room like a lyric you can’t forget — bold,
            unpredictable, and burning with quiet fire. She’s sugar and sarcasm, dreams in neon, and lives life with the
            volume turned all the way up. With a soft heart wrapped in barbed wire, she fights for what she loves and
            never settles for less than magic. Whether she’s dancing like nobody’s watching or dropping truth bombs
            mid-convo, Apoorva doesn’t just follow trends — she breaks the rules and writes her own. Rebel Kid isn’t a
            label, it’s her love language.</p>
